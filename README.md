## Project Overview

This repository is dedicated to the robustness evaluation of the proposed adaptive ACM watermarking technique outlined in our research. It includes the implementation of various image processing attacks and the corresponding results of watermark extraction. The project aims to assess the resilience of the watermarking method under different conditions, ensuring its reliability for secure medical image applications. 

### Key Features:
- **Attack Simulation**: Implementation of common image processing attacks, such as noise addition, rotation, compression, and cropping, to test the robustness of the watermark.
- **Watermark Extraction**: Procedures for extracting and evaluating the watermark post-attack, validating its imperceptibility and stability.
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed results showcasing Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), and Equal Error Rate (EER) for each attack scenario.

This repository provides valuable insights into the methodâ€™s effectiveness against tampering, ensuring data integrity and patient privacy in medical imaging.
